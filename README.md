ZKRent

Overview

ZKRent is a private and secure way to rent a home or apartment without revealing any sensitive information. Our solution ensures privacy while providing the necessary validation to facilitate rental agreements.

Features

	•	Privacy-Preserving: Renters can prove they meet income requirements without disclosing their actual income.
	•	Fraud Prevention: Verification through Worldcoin ensures that the renter is a real person.

How It Works

	1.	Income Validation:
We use ZoKrates to implement the logic that validates whether the renter’s income is greater than the amount requested by the apartment owner. This process involves generating a zero-knowledge proof, which is stored on the Polygon network via a smart contract.
	2.	User Verification:
By integrating Worldcoin, we validate that the user is a legitimate individual, helping to prevent fraud.

Smart Contracts

Deployment

The contracts and logic are deployed on the Polygon network, ensuring scalability and low transaction costs.
